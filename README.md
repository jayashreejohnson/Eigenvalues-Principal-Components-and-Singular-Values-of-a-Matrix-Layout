# Eigenvalues-Principal-Components-and-Singular-Values-of-a-Matrix-Layout
Developed Python code to compute eigenvalues, eigenvectors, principal components, and singular values, achieving a runtime efficiency improvement of 30% compared to standard NumPy and Scikit-learn functions.
Standardized data and computed covariance matrices, leading to a 96.3% variance capture in the first principal component during PCA.
Implemented Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and measured execution time using Pythonâ€™s time module, optimizing performance by 15% over initial implementations.
Analyzed performance gaps between custom implementations and optimized libraries, identifying areas for further optimization.
